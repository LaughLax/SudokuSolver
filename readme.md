This is a Sudoku app I built in Sep. 2019 to try out building an interface with `tkinter`.

Functionality:
* The app starts with no cells filled.
* Each cell has a 3x3 grid of buttons labeled 1-9.
* Values can be hidden or unhidden within each cell by right-clicking.
* A cell is filled by left-clicking the desired number.
* A puzzle can be prepared by filling in starting values and then selecting "Lock" from the "File" menu.
* Conflicting values are automatically marked in red. This is done naively; the app includes no algorithms to generate or solve the puzzle.
